Hello, I'm Ana. I'm a software developer. I like going to the gym. I, also, like tech. I'm [brazilian](https://www.reddit.com/media?url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.redd.it%2Fi-made-a-terraria-version-of-brazil-mentioned-v0-umdfi5mgr8ub1.jpg%3Fwidth%3D1170%26format%3Dpjpg%26auto%3Dwebp%26s%3Daa7d48e16897b404446107e5ac24f96df6cc77a2). And, I'm, also, portuguese. I've a weird fixation on japanese culture. And also I've another weird fixation on linguistics. And, I guess, it's really hard to define oneself in a blog post.

What I'm trying to say that I want to build a community that loves tech and also loves bodybuilding and that's the goal for Build-A-Body. I don't really care what you are, where are you from or if you like One Piece, if you like bodybuilding or tech or both, welcome home, I've been waiting.
